# Face-recognition--Attendance-System
It is a system for automatically marking attendance, built using openCV and Python
Abstract â€” The main objective of this project is to build a facial recognition and
identification system for tracking students' attendance to overcome the ambiguities
caused by traditional attendance tracking systems. In this project, face databases will be
created to pump data into the recognizer algorithm. Then, during the attendance-taking
session, faces will be compared against the database to seek identity. When an individual
is identified, their attendance will be taken down automatically, saving necessary
information into a sheet.
The primary purpose of this project is to build a face recognition-based attendance
monitoring system for educational institutions to enhance and upgrade the current
attendance system into more efficient and effective than before. Consider a
conventional attendance tracking system, how cumbersome it is to mark the
attendance for everyone manually! This itself is a time-consuming task and
moreover, the accuracy can also not be guaranteed as a third party may mark the
attendance for the absentees.
